# Spam Classifier using Python NLTK and Flask web app

## Step by step approach to the web application

  - Creating python project
  - Machine Learning model building
  - Export trained model
  - Export Tfidf object used to create training dataset
  - Set-up Flask environment
  - creating app.py which will have routes of index and other html files.
  - creating or using templates for attractive user interface.
  - create two directories namely templates and static in root directory of the project.
    - templates directory will have html files.
    - static directory will have css and javascript files.
  - Finally, create nltk.txt, requirements.txt and Procfile(shell script file.) in root directory.
  
## Steps to deploy the flask web app on heroku platform.
  - First of all, we need to create git repository for our project.
  - Upload all the project files inside github repository.
  - Go to [Heroku](Heroku.com) platform and login or create your account. It's free platform where we can host our ML/DL project web application.
  - Create your free Heroku project
  - Integrate your github profile
  - Search for the github repository within provided search bar.
  - Finally, deploy your machine learning Flask web application.
